# Triangle

## Classification
One of the main difficulties when analysing educational systems is how to compare them in a fair way. Each country and sometimes reach region has their own ways to classify the students through the lifecycle of the educational process.

We are going to use and classify students by its ages and how they are spelled in a few different countries: US, UK, France, Germany, Brazil, Argentina

#### ISCED 2011
We are going to use the 2011 **International Standard Classification of Education** developed by the UNESCO's Institute for Statistics. As they state in their documentation:
```
As national education systems vary in terms of structure and curricular content, it can be difficult to benchmark performance across countries over time or monitor progress towards national and international goals. In order to understand and properly interpret the inputs, processes and outcomes of education systems from a global perspective, it is vital to ensure that data are comparable. This can be done by applying the International Standard Classification of Education (ISCED), the standard framework used to categorise and report cross-nationally comparable education statistics. 
```

### My goals
My goals here are:
 1. Use this classification to the other **vertex** of our triangle: the quantification, where I intend to quantify in some specific geographies (eg. France and Brazil) how many students, schools and teachers belong to each division
 2. Use this classification to the other **vertex** of our triangle: the qualification, where I intend to detect the educational goals for each division and compare between the countries

### Why that?
Having the numbers and the **points of synergy** of content, it would be possible to prioritise the content development of a specific educational product
