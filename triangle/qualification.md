## France - Collège (Level 2 ISCED)
There are total of 26 hours of lessons each week for each year, with no more than 6 hours lessons a day.

Out of the 26 hours of compulsory education, there should be several hours each week (3 hours in the first year and 4 hours per week in later years) of 'complementary education', which takes the form of either interdisciplinary practical education and/or personalised support.
In addition, there are 10 hours of '*vie de la classe*' each year, normally for an our each month. It is devoted to the pupil's expression on the life of the class. It is a gathering that seeks to regulate tensions, to find ways of living together in a harmonious maneer.
Schools are also able to provide supplementary classes to support those with particular difficulties.
The following tables set out the subjects taught in each year of *collège*, together with the minimum number of teaching hours for each subject. The programme is broadly the same for the first three years, but with some variation in the final year.
Some ( but not much!) local variation is allowed on these programmes.
In particular, there are some schools that specialise in say music, sport or foreign languages, where there are additional hours in addition to basic curriculum.
There are also optional subjects generally available to pupils in their final year, taken in addition to the basic curriculum.
